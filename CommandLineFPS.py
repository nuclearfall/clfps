	Hello! Ultimately I don't care what you use this for. It's intended to be
	educational, and perhaps to the oddly minded - a little bit of fun.
	Please hack this, change it and use it in any way you see fit. You acknowledge
	that I am not responsible for anything bad that happens as a result of
	your actions. However this code is protected by GNU GPLv3, see the license in the
	github repo. This means you must attribute me if you use it. You can view this
	license here: https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/videos/blob/master/LICENSE
	Cheers!
    
    	From nuclearfall (.cpp to .py)
    	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   	This is pretty much a straight up copy of Javidx9's CLFPS logic from C++/Windows 
   	to Python/*Nix. I utilize the curses library for display. Anything that makes
   	it look worse is probably my fault, but I'm unlikely to play with this much, as
   	it was a learning excercise. 
    
   	If you want a better documented file, explaining exact goings on of the code,
   	you should download Javidx9's .cpp code. It has extensive documentation and
    	made it a lot easier for me to understand how ray tracing and shading works
    	in concept. Huge thanks go to Javidx9 for all of his work on video tutorials.

	Background
	~~~~~~~~~~
	Whilst waiting for TheMexicanRunner to start the finale of his NesMania project,
	his Twitch stream had a counter counting down for a couple of hours until it started.
	With some time on my hands, I thought it might be fun to see what the graphical
	capabilities of the console are. Turns out, not very much, but hey, it's nice to think
	Wolfenstein could have existed a few years earlier, and in just ~200 lines of code.

	IMPORTANT!!!!
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	READ ME BEFORE RUNNING!!! This program expects the console dimensions to be set to
	120 Columns by 40 Rows. I recommend a small font "Consolas" at size 16. You can do this
	by running the program, and right clicking on the console title bar, and specifying
	the properties. You can also choose to default to them in the future.

	Controls: A = Turn Left, D = Turn Right, W = Walk Forwards, S = Walk Backwards

	Future Modifications
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	1) Shade block segments based on angle from player, i.e. less light reflected off
	walls at side of player. Walls straight on are brightest.
	2) Find an interesting and optimised ray-tracing method. I'm sure one must exist
	to more optimally search the map space.
	3) Add bullets!
	4) Add bad guys!
