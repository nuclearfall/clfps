OneLoneCoder's CommandLineFPS translated from CPP to Python

This is as direct a translation as possible. It uses ncurses. It was written on a Mac and should definitely work on *Nix machines, but I'm not sure about Windows.

You can find the original CPP code: https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/CommandLineFPS

You can find the video he made explaining the code on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8skO7MFYw

I suppose this code is copyright me? Either way it's GPL3.
